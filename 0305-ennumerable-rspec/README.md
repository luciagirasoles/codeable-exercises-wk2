# Mini-assignments
## Week 2: Day 2

### Instructions

- Get together with your _**peer code-review**_ group. You will be giving feedback to the other members of your group on the solutions they present, as well as receiving feedback from them.
- Use the same repo from yesterday: `codeable-exercises-wk2`.
- Make sure to update by _pulling_ the changes from yesterday.
- Within this repository, create a directory `0305-ennumerable-rspec`. This is where you will store your solutions.
- Divide the work below between your team. All exercises should be resolved by the end of the period.
- Each team member should create _pull requests_ to the master branch in the original repo. Do not merge them yet.

### Peer code-review

- The last 10 minutes of the period are assigned to provide feedback to your team. Use Github's review feature to comment on their code within the _pull requests_.
- Use the last 5 minutes to review the comments from your peers. Based on their feedback, do you think you need to make changes to your code? Go ahead and do so!
- By the end of this 15-minute period, all exercises should be resolved in the `master` branch in the original repo.

Great job! ðŸ™Œ
